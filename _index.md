heroDescription: A list of software applications, libraries and hardware that includes support for Post Quantum Cryptography

---

The PKI Consortium is managing a PQC Capabilities Matrix (PQCCM) of software applications, libraries and hardware that includes support for 
Post Quantum Cryptography, without endorsing their implementation or quality.

The list includes a wide variety of software applications, libraries, and hardware from different vendors. 
The list should be considered a living document and a starting point. Considering the rapid change in the area such things can vary from day to day and complete freshness of information can only be gathered from vendors directly. 

The PKI Consortium is actively working to promote the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography, and the capabilities matrix is a key part of that effort.

**What the PQCCM does**:
* collects and aggregates information on PQC capabilities across the cybersecurity landspace (vendors, software, hardware, etc..)
* lists products that provide PQC functionality to the end user, not merely for example PQC enabled TLS access to a non PQC enabled service

No other activities besides those listed above are under the purview of PKI Consortium (unless explicitly stated otherwise).

**What the PQCCM doesn't do**:
* review, vet, verify or test implementations or interoperability
* perform source code review, formal review of algorithms, etc.
* provide information, documentation or any recommended usage of Post Quantum Cryptography

## Contribute

This list is a collaborative effort. To contribute please raise an issue or a PR on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pkic/pqccm).

## Capabilities

The table lists information from vendors related to support for Post Quantum Cryptography.
The list below lista algorithms standardized by FIPS. The previous list listing support for draft algorithms can now be found in on the separate [draftalgorithms](draftalgorithms.md) page.

## EVERTRUST

[EVERTRUST Stream](https://evertrust.io/stream/) is a PKI CA/VA/TSA and [EVERTRUST Horizon](https://evertrust.io/horizon/) is a PKI RA and CLM software. Both products are currently able to issue and manage pure-PQC and hybrid backard-compatible certificates based on Dilithium/Falcon/Sphincs+ algorithms. Released versions have support for ML-DSA (with or without prehash), pure PQC certificates, and hybrid backward-compatible certificates as per ITU-T X.509 10/19. 
Other algorithms and some protocol support as well as PKCS#11 support is available in beta versions, as they depend on standards that are not yet published.
